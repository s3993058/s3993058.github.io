    <h3>WHAT WAS THE FIRST THING YOU PAID ATTENTION TO WHEN INTERACTING WITH THE EXPERIENCE?</h3>
The background colour, video and the main bold text were the first things my eyes were drawn to. The colour is fairly unconventional, a soft light blue and it wasn’t something I was expecting upon opening the page. Combined with this is the visual representation of the loading, a series of big, bold letters randomly and quickly scrolling across the top and bottom. This rapid motion and bold graphics are visually interesting and initially eye catching. Finally, after the loading is complete a video taking up the majority of the screen begins to play. This dominates most of the website's visuals and is clearly meant to be focused on.

    <h3>SPEND TWO MINUTES WITH THE EXPERIENCE AND CREATE A LIST OF EACH OF YOUR DISCRETE ACTIONS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Read the elements that appear over the top of the video after a couple of seconds</li>
        <li>Scroll through to the next sections of the website after the initial information</li>
        <li>Enter one of the projects</li>
        <li>Scroll through and read the information and look at the visuals of the project</li>
        <li>Enter another project</li>
        <li>Repeat process</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>WHAT PART OF THE EXPERIENCE DID YOU SPEND THE MOST TIME ENGAGING WITH?</h3>
    Exploring the individual projects of the portfolio took up the most time during the experience. The home screen is laid out in a way that encourages entering the individual projects as they don’t give away too much information initially and they use inviting thumbnails for the user to enter. 

    <h3>WHAT WAS THE MOST COMMON ACTION IN YOUR TWO MINUTE INTERACTION WITH THE EXPERIENCE? </h3>
Scrolling through the pages was definitely the most common action, with clicking to move into other places being second. 

    <h3>WHAT IS YOUR IMPRESSION OF THE INTENDED PRIMARY GOAL OF THE INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCE?</h3>
From the experience it is clear that the goal of the website is to showcase the designer’s work. 

    <h3>HOW DOES THE INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCE COMMUNICATE THIS PRIMARY GOAL?</h3>
To best exhibit the work of the designer, effective layouts and selection of contents are essential. The portfolio is a design in and of itself, but importantly this does not detract from the usability of the website overall. The layout is intuitive and has a practical layout to easily guide a user through the designer’s work. The work is appropriately displayed but not completely shown on the home screen so as to not overstimulate the user.

    <h3>WHAT IS YOUR IMPRESSION OF HOW THE EXPERIENCE SHOULD BE INTERACTED WITH OVER TIME? (FOR HOW LONG AND HOW MANY DIFFERENT TIMES)</h3>
The portfolio is engaging for users both in the short and long terms but does have some shortcomings. The website flows very linearly, beginning with the information on the designer and then going on to his projects. This is very clear and easy to follow, but on multiple engagements, it’s unlikely that users will want to read the same information on the designer over and over again, and they will just scroll right past it. Perhaps it would be more effective to move this section somewhere else or compact it into its own section like one of the projects. 

    <h3>HOW DOES THE INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCE COMMUNICATE HOW IT SHOULD BE INTERACTED WITH OVER TIME?</h3>
The linear layout and user flow of the page makes it very easy to know what to engage with next, it would be difficult for a user to get lost or overly confused on the chronology of the website. Furthermore there is a section at the bottom of every page that lists out the designers’ previous projects, so the user doesn’t have to return to the main screen to visit other projects every time they want to move on. The user also doesn’t have to scroll through all the projects to get to the one they want.

    <h3>WHAT OTHER MEDIA FORMS (DIGITAL OR OTHERWISE) DOES THE EXPERIENCE REFERENCE?</h3>
Alongside the design of the website is included; ux and ui design, photo and video art direction, product design, and brand design all being shown as works within the folio of the designer. 

    <h3> WHAT DOES THIS REFERENCE/S COMMUNICATE TO YOU ABOUT HOW YOU SHOULD ACT WHEN ENGAGING WITH YOUR RESEARCH EXPERIENCE?</h3>
Researching this reference was particularly valuable for understanding how the layout and organisation of content impact usability and overall quality. This involves more than just the website's appearance; it touches on crucial aspects of usability and functionality. It was especially helpful to explore questions such as how much content should be shown on the homepage, the simplicity of the navigation system, the screen space allocated to each element, how the page's design influences clarity, and how to effectively realise the designer's original objectives.

    <h3>WHAT DOES THIS REFERENCE/S COMMUNICATE TO YOU ABOUT HOW YOU SHOULD FEEL WHEN ENGAGING WITH YOUR RESEARCH EXPERIENCE? </h3>
It was reassuring to experience no overstimulation or confusion when initially opening the portfolio page. This sense of clarity and purpose continued throughout the entire interaction with the reference. The well-designed and refined user interface significantly improved the quality of the experience and was a key takeaway from the research. The design struck a balance, being neither too simplistic to feel dull nor too complex to be cluttered or annoying to users.

    <h3>WHAT IS THE MOST FRUSTRATING PART OF THE INTERACTION TO YOU AND WHAT MAKES THAT PART FRUSTRATING?</h3>
The website was making my computer and phone work slowly due to its size, and the load time of the page itself was too long. The way the scrolling worked was not effective overall. It has been made to be extra smooth, so that it starts and ends gradually and speeds up a lot in the middle. This is visually appealing but is sometimes difficult to use.

    <h3>WHAT IS THE MOST SATISFYING PART OF THE INTERACTION AND WHAT MAKES MAKES THAT PART SATISFYING?</h3>
Exploring the individual projects of the designer’s work was the most enjoyable and satisfying section of the experience. The website itself is designed very nicely and is enjoyable to use, but it is clear that the focus of the website are the projects and the rest of the layout is there to facilitate a smooth user experience.
