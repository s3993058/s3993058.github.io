      REFLECTION
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="question1">Judgments of purpose</div>

        <div class="item1"> I wanted to create a tool that could be used to generate visual art. The aim of the tool was to have a high degree of interactivity and for the user to be able to adjust a number of parameters to control the tool’s output. Additionally the overall objective of the tool was to generate visually interesting and appealing art.</div>

      <div class="question2">Judgments of worth</div>

        <div class="item2">
          The core aspect of the tool was based on the design interaction principle, feedback. This was to be achieved as described above through the interaction between the user and the tool’s parameters creating a one to one feedback but featuring a great variety of possible outputs. Furthermore the most important values were this interactive feedback and the quality of the art produced.
        </div>

      <div class="question3">Judgments of framing</div> 

        <div class="item3">
          There were a number of elements that I wanted to implement in the tool that would have been too difficult and taken too much time to code. The main element that was decided to be too difficult was the generation of complex three dimensional shapes and their further stylisation through the adjustment of their visual properties. Other elements include more complex implementation of differing levels of randomness being applied to all the visual elements, particularly the slicing of images and the structuring of text. Furthermore the idea of creating a highly composed piece of art was deemed too difficult especially when the tool was so heavily focused around randomness. Initially there was an aim to also incorporate audio elements in the tool, however due to time constraints this was discarded. 
        </div>

      <div class="question4">Judgments of appearance</div>    

        <div class="item4">The aim of the website’s aesthetic style was to be heavily focused around the art generated. This means the adjustable parameters and any other element of the design would be minimal and almost all of the display would be taken up by the art itself. This was because the sole purpose of the tool is to generate visual art, any other element needed only to be functional and intuitive.</div>

      <div class="question5">Judgments of quality</div>

        <div class="item5">The technical implementation of the project was done in vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The most important decision for this aspect of the project’s creation was choosing between this and Konva.js. Considering the aim of the project, and my own personal knowledge of those programming languages it was decided that it was possible and the easiest method for the tool’s creation. </div>

      <div class="question6">Judgments of composition</div>

        <div class="item6">
          The original aim of the project was to create a tool that could generate high quality and highly adjustable visual art. Initially I expected there to be no problems in achieving the ideal balance between the quality of the output and the implementation of many adjustable parameters. However as I worked on the development of the website, it became clear, particularly towards the end of the production, that there would not be enough time to fully implement the parameters in the way that I would have liked. Time management and a number of technical difficulties made it impossible to achieve the balance I wanted, and I prioritised the creation of a high quality output above the other aspects of the tool. 
        </div>

      <div class="question7">Judgments of navigation</div>

        <div class="item7">The number one priority during the development of the project was to ensure the tool was capable of generating art that was of good quality. This was the priority as it is the most fundamental purpose of the tool; even without high adjustability there can still be a good output, whereas if the tool had exceptional adjustability and interactivity but subpar output, it would not be usable. After the successful creation of a high quality art generator would come the implementation of parameters that would allow for the adjusting of the output.</div>
