      ANALYSIS
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="question1">What genre of creative software do you believe it belongs to?</div>

        <div class="item1"> Intersymmetric by Mark Fell and Rian Treanor is in the genre of collaborative web music software, focusing on the potential of collaborative efforts between an audience and collaborators. It features a system of programming rhythmic drum machine music that is unique, unlike other traditional music making softwares and digital audio workspaces, collaborative or otherwise.</div>

      <div class="question2">List three other examples of software in this genre:</div>

        <div class="item2">
          <li>Ableton Live - A professional music production software that also includes real time collaborative features but with a massively greater capacity for complex music production.</li>
          <li>Max MSP - A software that is used for audiovisual programming and can be used for the production of music. Similar to Intersymmetric, it contains a unique programming method as well as collaborative capabilities.</li>
          <li>Touchdesigner - Like Max MSP, Touchdesigner is a modular audiovisual programming software. While it does not have the same capacity for music production as either Max MSP or Ableton, it does have a greater ability to create complex interactive audiovisual experiences and art pieces.</li>
          </div>

      <div class="question3">List the program's interactive features/mechanics (one sentence max explanation per feature/mechanic):</div> 

        <div class="item3">
          <li>Various buttons; to play and pause, to adjust the bpm, to adjust the options of the sequencers and to turn the on and off.</li>
          <li>Virtual knobs that the user can click and drag to choose between certain aspects of the rhythm and sounds such as what the sound is, its pitch, its length, and the number of times it recurs in the sequence.</li>
          <li>A bar representing the sequence that the user can click and drag on to alter certain parameters for each drum element.</li>
          <li>These are the main interactive features of the three drum machine sequencers that Intersymmetric has, being simple enough to allow for a cohesive collaborative experience.</li>
          </div>

      <div class="question4">What features/mechanics indicate its genre by aligning with its conventions?</div>    

        <div class="item4">The real-time sound manipulation and the ability for multiple users to contribute align with conventions of collaborative music software. Also, the focus on generative and algorithmic music techniques is in line with other experimental electronic music tools and softwares.</div>

      <div class="question5">What features/mechanics are novel for its genre?</div>

        <div class="item5">The algorithmic approach that Intersymmetric takes to drum sequencing and programming is unlike any other music making software. Where other programs give the user midi sequences for programming or a timeline to arrange recorded audio, Intersymmetric gives the user a set of buttons and dials that control the parameters of the sequence. However, the sequencer 01 also allows the user to create a drum track through midi in a way that is similar to traditional digital audio workstations. Unlike many collaborative music platforms that allow separate user tracks, Intersymmetric features a fully shared interface where every action influences the entire system. The emphasis on unpredictability and live interaction with minimal traditional composition tools sets it apart from structured music production software. </div>

      <div class="question6">What features/mechanics common to its genre are missing or might be added?</div>

        <div class="item6">
          <li>A recording/export function would be valuable for users who want to capture their sessions and revisit them later.</li>
          <li>More customisable sound parameters, such as effects, synthesis options, or time signature editor would expand creative possibilities.</li>
          <li>The addition of other instruments for a more complete audio interface that could be used to create entire musical pieces rather than just the drums.</li>
          <li>A chat or messaging system could enhance collaboration by allowing users to communicate their creative intentions during a session.</li>
        </div>

      <div class="question7">What context, community, or niche is it primarily aimed at and what indicates this?</div>

        <div class="item7">The software is primarily aimed at experimental electronic musicians, digital artists, and those interested in algorithmic and generative music, however because its mechanics are very simple and easy to use, Intersymmetric is still accessible to a wide audience that doesn’t necessarily have to have prior musical knowledge. It is a tool that is geared towards creating experimental and unconventional drum sequences through the use of unconventional interactive programming features, so the audience that would find it most useful would be musicians or performers specialising in this artistic area.</div>

      <div class="question8">What did you find annoying and/or boring about interacting with it?</div>

        <div class="item8">The inability to export or record sounds was a frustration after having created an interesting drum sequence and finding that it was impossible to easily export it. Furthermore, some elements of the interface and individual interactive features are counterintuitive and not the easiest to understand. For example the “shape” and “shape scale” parameters in Sequencer 01, and the way the user divides the timeline of the drum elements in the nnnb sequencer were not at all understandable immediately. The entire interface of the AAA sequencer is also difficult to understand, however in this instance it may add to the experimental nature of the sequencer.</div>

      <div class="question9">What did you find enjoyable about interacting with it?</div> 

        <div class="item9">The interactive parameters that the software did offer were interesting and made it easy to create complex drum sequences. There is a lot of room for experimentation, both sonically and rhythmically, despite there being no other instruments, parameters such as pitch and shape made it possible to create interesting sounds. Finally the process of creating a sequence and having it come together into a cohesive structure is very gratifying and enjoyable.</div>
