    <h3>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
The general layout of the page, and the videos being played within. Immediately my eyes were drawn to the videos as they were the only moving elements in a fairly plain website. The layout is quite unconventional, emulating the style of an advent calendar, and having a relatively large section of the screen to the left dedicated to information on the designer with the rest being a scrollable display of the work within the portfolio caught my attention quickly. 

    <h3>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Hover and read elements on the left of the screen</li>
        <li>Scroll through the projects on the right of the screen</li>
        <li>Enter one of the projects</li>
        <li>Read information about the project on the left</li>
        <li>Scroll through the videos and images of the project</li>
        <li>Enter another project</li>
        <li>Repeat process</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
Exploring the individual projects of the portfolio took up the most time during the experience. The home screen is organised well enough to give only necessary information on the designs and to intrigue the user into opening and looking at them individually. 

    <h3>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
Scrolling through the pages was definitely the most common action, with clicking to move into other places being second. 

    <h3>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
From the experience it is clear that the goal of the website is to showcase the designerâ€™s work. 

    <h3>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
To best exhibit the work of the designer, effective layouts and selection of contents are essential. The portfolio is a design in and of itself, but importantly this does not detract from the usability of the website overall. The layout is unconventional yet practical and unobtrusive. The work is appropriately displayed but not completely shown on the home screen so as to not overstimulate the user. The navigation is intuitive and easily understood. 

    <h3>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>
The portfolio is engaging for users both in the short and long terms. Initially a user can easily explore the main work chronologically going at whatever pace they may choose, however there are a number of small elements of the page that make longer interactive experiences more fruitful. Examples include things like having clickable advent calendar doors on the homepage with small easter eggs that the user can drag and drop, or can turn the interface red upon clicking.
