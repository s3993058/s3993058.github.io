    <h1>ASSIGNMENT 1 - MYOUNGAE KIM</h1>
    <h2>yanni kontos - s3993058</h2>

    <h3>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
    The general layout of the page, and the videos being played within. Immediately my eyes were drawn to the videos as they were the only moving elements in a fairly plain website. The layout is quite unconventional, emulating the style of an advent calendar, and having a relatively large section of the screen to the left dedicated to information on the designer with the rest being a scrollable display of the work within the portfolio caught my attention quickly.
