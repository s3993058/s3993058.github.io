    <h3>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
The general layout of the page, and the videos being played within. Immediately my eyes were drawn to the videos as they were the only moving elements in a fairly plain website. The layout is quite unconventional, emulating the style of an advent calendar, and having a relatively large section of the screen to the left dedicated to information on the designer with the rest being a scrollable display of the work within the portfolio caught my attention quickly. 

    <h4>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Hover and read elements on the left of the screen</li>
        <li>Scroll through the projects on the right of the screen</li>
        <li>Enter one of the projects</li>
        <li>Read information about the project on the left</li>
        <li>Scroll through the videos and images of the project</li>
        <li>Enter another project</li>
        <li>Repeat process</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h5>
    Exploring the individual projects of the portfolio took up the most time during the experience. The home screen is organised well enough to give only necessary information on the designs and to intrigue the user into opening and looking at them individually.
